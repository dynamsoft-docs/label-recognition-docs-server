- Supports text recognition from BMP, JPEG, PNG and single-page TIFF files.
- Supports zonal OCR and provides three ways to localize text areas:
    - Pre-define an area manually in pixel or percentage.
    - Specify an area relative to the barcode zone, which allows you to recognize accompanying texts near the barcode. 
    - Specify an area relative to blocks which share the same colour or uses the same font colour. A common example would be a price tag, where the text of interest is always on a yellow square background, the yellow square can serve as the reference region.
- Supports specifying a regular expression to improve recognition accuracy and robustness.
